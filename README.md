# VideoBrowser
A video browser I built to help sync videos between computers

###What does this do?###
 - This repo is primary for personal backup purposes
 - This is basically a file browser, where you can enter multiple locations on your PC, as well as remote FTP locations
 - It will list out all the files that are on each, and tell you if the files exist on the other PCs
 - It will auto download info for movies, if a directory is tagged as a movies directory

###How do I use this?###
 - Install node.js
 - CD to the root directory and `npm install` to install the modules
 - Run `node app.js` (or run Run.bat)
 - Visit `127.0.0.1:3000` in your browser
 - You might want to edit `dirSettings.json` and `serverSettings.json`

###I need support / help / have suggestions###
 - Thos project is no longer supported, it comes "as is"
